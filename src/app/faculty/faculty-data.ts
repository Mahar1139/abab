    bio: `Welcome to Himalaya Public School Website. As the Admin of the reputable institution I consider it my privilege to pen down my message for our newly launched website of our school. I feel very fortunate to work with many dedicated, committed, caring and innovative staff members, parents and students.  

Many people consider education as a medium of getting good jobs, living a royal life, earning money and much more. But education doesn’t really mean this. Real meaning comes when one’s way of thinking gets changed and one starts thinking for the betterment of the society, country and world at large. On the whole education means holistic development of a child not only restricted to the achievements of academics but also helping the child to come up with those inherited knowledge to build a better tomorrow; with a disciplined way of life.

At Himalaya Public School, we believe that every child is a gift of God, and that excellence is the way of life. Keeping this in mind we provide the students value based education, opportunities to grow in every sphere of life both in academics and in their personality development. In the field of co- curricular activities, games, and sports our students are paving their way towards great heights.

I take this opportunity to thank God Almighty for his benevolence, generous blessings showered upon our institution through various people and events. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Rev. Sr Philomena, the Principal who always guides, gives confidence, inspires and supports me in all that I do. I extend my gratitude to all the staff members for their constant amicable support towards the institution. Finally I want to thank all the students of Himalaya Public School for their contribution and important role they play in the School to take the School to a greater height as per the Motto “Let Your Light Shine.”

Thank you and God Bless You!`,
